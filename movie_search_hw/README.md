# React Movie Search Homework

<h2>Goal</h2>

* For every letter you type, you will get movie results on the ui, and you'll be able to click on those links and/or movie posters to get to their imdb page.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

* Watch the video in the repo for an example of how it should/could work
* Use react.js
* Have a search bar at the top of the page (input)
* make sure you use the onChange function within the input
* use the omdb api. Let me know when you start. I will message you the api key.
* You can use the node_modules from the react_api directory, as you need axios to query the omdb api.
* Store the search results and input into the state and see what you can do with that, being they are globally scoped.
* OMDB API Documentation links: https://www.omdbapi.com/
* OMDB Example usage with jQuery: https://github.com/nycda-wdi-jared/jquery-ajax/blob/485bb7ac9b447bc37c9ebead18e13100c0bf4aa2/1.1-First_Ajax/exercise_1.1/solved/omdb_api.js
* When calling the api, use ```&s=``` instead of ```&t=``` to get more search results
