# React Postgres Password Matcher

* Using react.js, node.js, sequelize, & bcrypt
* You need to have a database with at least one field with a username and a password that was encrypted by bcrypt
* On the server side, look for comments in your controller/routes.js
* On the client side, look for comments in your /client/app/components/PasswordMatcher.jsx
* Look at this repo on how you use bcrypt and bcrypt.compare: https://github.com/nycda-wdi-jared/bcrypt_compare/blob/master/server/controllers/route-controller.js
