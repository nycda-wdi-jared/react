# React

<h2> Routing </h2>

* As you see in the routes.js file, all of the front-end/ui routing is done from the client side
* This is where you define your routes that people will be able view and direct through the website
* The back-end routes are merely for sending and receiving data. We will get to that soon.

<h2> Running React App </h2>

* Open up two terminals
* From the main directory of the project in both terminals:
	* run ```webpack -w```
		* this will update with changes on the ui & show if there's an error on the ui
	* run ```npm start```
		* this will run your server, and you will open up your page on the local host and the port the server is running on, i.e. ```http://localhost:<PORT>```

<h2> Installing Webpack </h2>

* Install webpack (globally & locally per project)
